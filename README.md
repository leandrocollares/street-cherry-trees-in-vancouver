# Street cherry trees in Vancouver

There are thousands of cherry trees in Vancouver. This exploratory data analysis relies on data from the City of Vancouver Open Data Portal to answer the following questions:

- How many street cherry trees are there in Vancouver?

- What are the most common and uncommon street cherry trees?

- Where are they located?

The analysis was conducted with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) and [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) were employed to create interactive charts and maps, respectively.
